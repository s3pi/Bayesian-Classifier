### Bayesian-Classifier
The take away from using Bayesian classifier on the different types of data points is Linear data which can be discriminated with a line, can do almost as good with quadratic decision boundaries also. Real world data that we are dealing with, are spaced such that, linear boundary or quadratic boundary is not making much of a difference, as we can see from the performance matrix. The key observation is with nonlinear data. Quadratic decision boundaries are performing more than 2 times better than linear decision boundary on nonlinear data.
